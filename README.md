# IB-Trading-System
Automatic trading system with IB

Will update description shortly. Input JSON should look like {tikcer:[price, volume, units to buy, stop%, trailing stop/window%, limit when trailing kicks in%], ....}

Noticed a bug, does not affect normal use only exception cases, will fix it later.
